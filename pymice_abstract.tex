IntelliCage is an automated system for recording the behavior of a group of mice 
housed together. It produces rich, detailed behavioral data calling for new 
methods and software for their analysis. Here we present PyMICE -- a free and open source
library for analysis of IntelliCage data in Python programming language. 
We describe the design and demonstrate the use of the library through 
a series of examples.  PyMICE provides easy and intuitive 
access to IntelliCage data, and thus facilitates the possibility of using 
numerous other Python scientific libraries to form a complete data analysis workflow.
