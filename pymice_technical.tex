We recommend to use the PyMICE library with the Anaconda Python distribution~\cite{anacondaSoftware}.

The library requires \emph{NumPy}~\cite{wald2011,Oliphant:2007ud},
\emph{matplotlib}~\cite{citeulike:2878517}, \emph{dateutil}~\cite{dateutil} and \emph{pytz}~\cite{pytz}
Python packages to be installed in the system.

\begin{samepage}
The library itself is available as a package from the Python Package Index (PyPI)~\cite{pep0301,pypi}
for Python version 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5, as well as 2.7.
It can be installed with either \emph{pip}~\cite{pip}:

\begin{verbatim}
$ pip install PyMICE
\end{verbatim}

or \emph{easy\_install}~\cite{setuptools}:

\begin{verbatim}
$ easy_install PyMICE
\end{verbatim}
\end{samepage}

A bleeding edge version of the library might be also downloaded from
\url{https://github.com/Neuroinflab/PyMICE} GitHub~\cite{github} repository.
